-- The BETWEEN operator is used in a WHERE clause to filter the result set within a certain range.
-- The range must be separated by an AND keyword.

-- SELECT *
-- FROM shows
-- WHERE year
-- BETWEEN 2020 AND 2025;

-- Presents shows with names that begin with A up to D
-- SELECT *
-- FROM shows
-- WHERE name
-- BETWEEN 'A' AND 'D';

-- Note: BETWEEN stops at the second letter, but doesnâ€™t include values that begin with the second letter.
